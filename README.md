# Space Invaders Game

## Introduction
This is a simple version of the classic Space Invaders game. I made it using Pygame, which is a library that helps you create games in Python. 
The game has basic stuff like moving the spaceship, shooting bullets, and hitting enemies. There’s also some background music and sound effects to make it more fun.

## Features
- Player can move left and right.
- Player can shoot bullets to destroy enemies.
- Enemies move towards the player and the game ends if they reach the player.
- Score tracking.
- Game Over and Restart functionality.
- Background music and sound effects.

## How to Play
- Use the left and right arrow keys to move.
- Press the spacebar to shoot.
- Try to shoot all the enemies before they reach you!

## Challenges Faced
- **Understanding Pygame Library**: This was my first time using Pygame, and it took me a while to understand how it works. I watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials and slowly started figuring things out..
- **Collision Detection**: I wanted the bullet to hit the enemy when they touch, so I used a little math (Pythagorean theorem) to check when they’re close enough. It was tricky to get the distance right, but it works now!
- **Game Over Functionality**: I had to figure out how to display a game-over screen and let the player restart the game without it glitching. It took some trial and error as I had to ensure the game reset correctly and all variables were initialized properly.

## Key Learnings
- **Pygame Fundamentals**: This project gave me a solid understanding of how Pygame works and how to use it for game development.
- **Problem-Solving**: Each challenge I faced helped me develop my problem-solving skills, especially when debugging and fixing issues in the game.
- **Version Control**: I learned how to use GitHub to manage my project and keep track of changes, which is essential for any developer.

## Deployment
I deployed the game on [Heroku/AWS/Google Cloud - choose one] so it can be played online.
